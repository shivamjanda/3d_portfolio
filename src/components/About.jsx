        I am a second-year student at Durham College. The program I am in is computer programming and I plan on transferring to Ontario Tech University to get my computer science degree. I have always enjoyed coding and computer-related activities growing up. I am interested in many industries in this field, including, video game development, web programming, cloud engineering, AI, etc. As a hard-working person who is extremely passionate and finds joy in his field, 
        I am really excited to advance further in the workplace with a variety of skills from different fields in software development / computer science.
